# Genesis
Genesis is a simple Atmel Microcontrollers Programming Library written in C. The main objective of the project is to make simple MCU programming, creating a useful and high-level syntax library, easy-to-use and well documented. Read more about Genesis [here](http://wiki.github.com/pedrofranceschi/Genesis).

# Documentation
Take a look at [Genesis Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/pedrofranceschi/Genesis) for Documentation.

# Sample Codes
Take a look at the ['sample-codes/'](http://github.com/pedrofranceschi/Genesis/tree/eccdce9cddbb3eb61e1ad30ddeb79eded35f2fe2/sample-codes) folder. The codes are all commented. You may need to change somethings in the Makefile for some MCUs.
